the tk extension extracted from core and gem-ified
gem install tk_as_gem

originally extracted from 1.9.1p376, then added a minor change to make it work with mingw/msys.

To install into an existing mingw distro:
install ActiveTcl [c:\tcl] (should add itself to the path)
C:>gem install tk_as_gem

Note: ruby.exe and your tcl dir must be on the same drive.

Should install for linux, as well, I think (1.9+).

Note that this only works for 1.9 -- for 1.8 mingw you can install some binaries from here:

Bugs:

currently it appears to require a ctrl+c to exit out of ruby, once you've done a
require 'tk'
of the gem.
